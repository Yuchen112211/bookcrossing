1. I really like your idea of book sharing.
The website is clean and beautiful.
Having a landing page and a section to explain how your app work is a good idea. 

2. Validate mailing address when user register:
As your app is doing book exchanges and requires users to mail books to other people,
I think it’s important to validate the user’s address to ensure they can successfully mail and receive books. 

3. Default avatar:
I think having a default avatar without allowing users to change it may not be a very good idea,
since some user don’t like the default avatar (your default avatar is a handsome man but the users may be a girl lol).
Or changing the default one to something more common like a person icon may be better.

4. Files are well organized and the project structure is clear. Nice job!
